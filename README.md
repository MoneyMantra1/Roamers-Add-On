# Roamers Add-On (NeoForge 1.21.1)

A small **dependent** add-on mod for **Roamers** that improves Roamer quality-of-life.

## Features
- Roamers spawn with saplings matching the wood types used in their structures (default: 8 of each type).
- If a Roamer has been looking for the same required item for 5 minutes, the add-on provides a small stack of that item.
- Right-click a Roamer with a **stick** to get a friendly status message about what they are doing / looking for.
- When the Roamer has placed their initial **campfire** and **crafting table**, the add-on places a **chest** nearby and drops **one of each sapling variant** they currently carry onto the ground.

## Notes
- This mod **requires** Roamers and will not load without it.
- The add-on uses reflection and vanilla/NeoForge events to avoid patching Roamers itself.
